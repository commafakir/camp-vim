# Visual Mode

VIM has visual mode. Which is like selecting text (maalaaminen).

Enter visual mode with `<shift>v` (line visual mode).

Enter block visual mode with `<ctrl>v`.

Visual mode is some what a helper, and the god level of VIM is that you don't need visual mode at all.

Level 0: not knowing about Vim
